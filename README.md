# 42 Get_Next_Line

Welcome to the 42 Get_Next_Line project repository! This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and focuses on creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor.

## Introduction

The 42 Get_Next_Line project involves creating a function called `get_next_line` that reads a line from a file descriptor (e.g., standard input, a file) and returns it without the newline character. The function is designed to handle reading from multiple file descriptors without losing the reading thread's context.

## Features

- Implementation of the `get_next_line` function
- Reading a line from a file descriptor
- Handling multiple file descriptors
- Dynamic memory allocation for line buffers
